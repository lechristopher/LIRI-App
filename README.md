# LIRI-App

My version of Siri in the node terminal. Pulls from the OMDB movie database, Twitter's API and Spotify. Specific commands are input into the terminal. 
Process.argv allows for certain arguments to be "processed" so that it will know when to draw from the Twitter, Spotify or OMDB databases.
